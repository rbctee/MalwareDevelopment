# Shellcode Runner

## C

To compile the C template on Linux, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o shellcode_runner shellcode_runner.c
```

## Nim

The file `shellcode_runner.nim` is a template written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) that allows you to run arbitrary shellcode.

To compile it:

```bash
# set the stack as executable
nim c -l='-fno-stack-protector -z execstack' shellcode_runner.nim
```

The compiler options are needed as the shellcode is stored on the stack, which is set as NX (Non-Executable) by default by the `GCC` compiler.

Type of executable generated on `x86-64` systems:

```bash
file shellcode_runner

# shellcode_runner:
#     ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable
#     x86-64
#     version 1 (SYSV)
#     dynamically linked
#     interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=a2c9a039e5144c90794d27f05a62c90fce21b88e
#     for GNU/Linux 3.2.0
#     not stripped
```
